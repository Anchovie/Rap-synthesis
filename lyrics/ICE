95
You looking at the grand _ wizard,
 war lord vocal chord so _ vicious
And I don't have to show _ riches 
to pull up pull off with some bad _ bitches
And it ain't about _ chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and _ delivery
It's about my _ persona 
ain't nothing like a man that can do what _ he wanna
Ain't nothing like man on that you knew on _ the corner
See 'em come up and fuck up _ the owner
See 'em throw up Westside _ California
Nigga I'm hot as Phoenix _ Arizona
I'm Utah I got multiple _ bitches
It's a new law keep a hold of yo _ riches 
Dumb nigga don't spend it as soon as you _ get it
And recognize I'm a captain and you a _ lieutenant
