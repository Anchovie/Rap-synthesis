90
My family don't understand what I _ go through
Under diagnosed for 20 years, ain't never _ broke through
You ever been in such a fog you don't _ know you?
Never being able to do the shit you're _ supposed to?
I wouldn't wish it on anyone _ that I'm close to
Wouldn't wish it on anybody _ that I'm opposed to
There's not an accurate diagnosis to _ show you
Basic neurobiology isn't _ close to
I'm watching life as a _ spectator
I can't help myself, even though I possessed _ data
It's not a part of my spirit to want to _ test nature
You think you know what I'm feeling, then _ let's wager
I'm having trouble retaining _ new information
Familiar scenes starting to look foreign- _ derealization
Everybody tired of being _ patient
Mama wondering why her baby crying in the _ basement
Constant rumination just _ exacerbates it
To the point where I can't even _ barely narrate it
I've had doctors tell me that my mind is _ fascinating
But they can't tell me why the sickness has _ been activated
