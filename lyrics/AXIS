100

The truth is in the building and _ I came tonight
I wonder if you'll pay attention if _ I change the price
And all of you say i have a dream the _ dreamer
The mirror says you are the next American _ leader
this thug'll balance beams just _ to smuggle
Just a lie to my people that's caught up in _ the struggle
It's always gonna be a struggle in _ this hustle
Xzibit shall hustle, lift _ build muscle

Livin in the world of crime tonight _ takes a life
Take it from a ninja in scribes _ stay alive
No! A lot of dreams are lost in _ the night
Drugs rain from the sky it's like the angels want me _ to die
Livin in the world of crime tonight _ takes a life
Take it from a ninja in scribes _ stay alive
No! A lot of dreams are lost in _ the night
Drugs rain from the sky it's like the angels want me _ to die
