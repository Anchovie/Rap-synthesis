Now we was once two niggaz of _ the same kind
Quick to holla at a bitch with _ the same lines
Quick to draw on a nigga with _ the same nines
But at the same time, we was on some _ different shit
'Cuz you was with a bitch, that I beg to _ differ wit
I told you sniff a bit, and you could get a _ whif of it
But you kept a closed nose, when it came to _ those hoes
And I'm your nigga so I tried to smell em _ wrong for ya
Wasn't there to take the fo' fo' _ lost for ya
But if you hear me, I dedicate this _ song for ya
He was setup in a stick up, by a girl he used _ to pick up
On the upper west side I used to help him chop _ a brick up
They found him in his pickup, pants down and _ dick up
Leanin' with one in his head, and one in his _ chest
One of the best at this husslin' _ shit
But his downfall was that he put his trust in a _ bitch
And it's fucked up _
