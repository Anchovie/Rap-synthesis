I know you wanna get behind the wheel but only one _ Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a _ diver
Can't let go, I got fans in _ Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and _ surviors
Norway no you didn't get my _ flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a _ Coward
Face just showered the minute in a _ hour
Heard about the news whole day went _ sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a _ lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as _ cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get _ arrested
Ain't worried about the killers just the young and _ restless
Gettin' mad cause the quarter million on my _ necklace
DUI never said I was driving _ reckless
You and I know that jealously is not _ impressive
Oh no I can't stop, I was _ destined
