It's young Mac a bee and _ Rapsody.
Tell These motherfuckers that they haven't heard the _ last of me
All over the map like latitude, Rhyming with an _ attitude
This is the beginning, you ain't even got to chapter _ two
I don't have to battle you, I'm better than _ you is
Four year old bars, you ain't worthy of _ new shit
Corey and Topanga, you can watch the boy meet _ world
With the homie Rapsody, aahh return of the B _ girl
