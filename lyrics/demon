We lost a friend_ today
We'll just pretend to _ pray
And we won't cry about _ it
we didn't like him _ anyway
We'll tuck the pain _ inside
better just to wait _ and hide
Say goodbye forever through _ the
shadows cast on lazy _ eyes
The more I think about _ it
we were just _ kids
listening to death _ music
looking for excuses to _ live
With all our vampire make up _ on
we were just _ kids but just you 
wait until you _ see what we did
And we can climb up on _ the
roof top when it gets _ dark
and shout the names of all _ our
lovers to the beat of our _ hearts
And we can smash out all _ the
windows under the _ moon
but will it save us from _ the
weight of growing up too _ soon
Where is your yellow _ balloon?
Don't let _ go
Don't let _ go
Don't let _ go
Don't let _ go
Don't let _ go
