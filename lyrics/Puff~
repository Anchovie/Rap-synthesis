105
Seems like yesterday we used to _ rock the show
I laced the track, you _ locked the flow
So far from hangin on the block _ for dough
Notorious, they got to know _ that
Life ain't always what it _ seem to be
Words can't express what you _ mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still _ a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill _ your dream

In the future, can't wait _ to see
If you'll open up the gates _ for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my _ friend
Try to black it out, but it plays _ again
When it's real, feelings hard to _ conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I _ feel
Give anything to hear half your _ breath
I know you still living your life, after _ death
