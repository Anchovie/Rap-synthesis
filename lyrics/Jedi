90
Mommy, I'm sorry if my first letter made _ you cry
To be honest with you, I don't think that I want _ to Die!
Sometimes I feel like that I'm cancerous in other's _ lives
That's probably why I drink at night and sleep 'til four or _ five
It's kind of hard walkin' through life with my distorted _ eyes
When I was younger, I was stupid and I thought I'd _ thrive
I thought a lot about everything I said in _ the letter
And questioned whether or not if I was dead, you'd _ be better
You think my shorty would be happy if I _ never met her?
It's too late now, mommy, I could _ never forget her
Could never forget how she taught me _ to love
Cause my father and my grandmother is always _ above
It's glory above, you know that daddy taught me to _ thug
And every time we was with nanny she'd bombard me with _ hugs
Damn, I miss her, mommy, and it's hard to _ believe
That I'm grown and I don't understand it, why did they _ leave?
It's better to die and _ sleep
The never waking _ sleep
Than linger on and dare to _ liive
When the soul's life is _ gone
