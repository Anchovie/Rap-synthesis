Maneuver through the computer to do_a little song
Got my first pair of Jordans for them_nickel rocks
A short circuit like an_electrical shock
and with me women be building these_skeptical walls
Cuz were all_a little strong
Made a little money bought me_a little Rov'
I saw a smaller version of me_in a crystal ball
Tipsy off a little Cristi'_a little Dom
